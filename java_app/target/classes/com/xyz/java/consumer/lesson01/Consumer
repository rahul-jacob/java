Interface Consumer<T>

This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.


@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T>
Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. Unlike most other functional interfaces, Consumer is 
expected to operate via side-effects.

This is a functional interface whose functional method is 

accept(Object)

a)	void	accept(T t)
			Performs this operation on the given argument.

b)	default Consumer<T>	andThen(Consumer<? super T> after)
			Returns a composed Consumer that performs, in sequence, this operation followed by the after operation.
