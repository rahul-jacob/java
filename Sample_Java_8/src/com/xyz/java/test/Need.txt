nope 
its nested or mapped diagnostic context 
Concept is we log things but we loose track for which request 
With this you can setup the context and that context will be available in any method

So we can write filter and assign request id to each request so that request id will be available in any of the method 
So while loggin we can use this request id. 
so it is easier to corelate logged data 
Ok so one more item to brush up. ->>
